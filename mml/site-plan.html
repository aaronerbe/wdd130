        We’re Aaron and Tina.  We decided years ago to step into a simpler way of life for our family of 7.  We chose to move away from the comforts of suburban life and build our dream home in the mountains.  We wanted to give our children the experiences of living away from the city and participating in things like 4H and learning to be self-sustained.  Admittedly, in many ways we were ignorant to what to expect and how to actually make it happen.  Like realizing that our minivan with “all season” tires was fine for winter driving in the city but not even close to a realistic option when driving up a mountain road that’s more ice rink and potholes than road.  Or if we want to stay warm when you heat with wood, we might actually need to stock enough wood to make it through

      <p>What to Expect</p>
      <p>
        We share our mistakes and challenges and what we’ve learned in hopes to inspire you.  You’ll be able to see what we’ve faced and how we dealt with it so you’ll know what you can expect when starting up something like raising 4h sheep and pigs, training a wild mustang, harvesting firewood or building a greenhouse.

      <p>DIY Solutions</p>
      <p>  
        We don’t just show mistakes and challenges.  We want to show our viable and sustainable solutions.  You can expect to find clear images with steps-by-step instructions detailing what supplies and materials and tools are needed to for a successful project.  Using this, you’ll be able to work through your own solutions and adapt as needed for your unique challenges.  Doing it yourself empowers you as you learn to be self-reliant and capable.  It can also save you considerable cost if done right.

      <p>Gear & Tools Recommendations</p>
      <p>
        You would think that harvesting 10 cords of wood a year would require a big and expensive splitter.  It’s often one of the first things we see people purchasing when getting into harvesting their own firewood.  However, we’ve found a simple, small (and cheap) electric splitter is just as effective and often faster.  As we’ve gone through our journey, we’ve learned the value of the right tools and equipment.  That does not always mean the most expensive ones.  In fact, it often doesn’t.  Our hope is to help provide an idea of what you should expect to need to get started and what will be needed down the road.  We share what we’ve proven as effective and reliable so you can be sure you’re making a good investment.  We’ll also share what we’ve tried that wasn’t reliable or effective so you know what to avoid.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        We live in the mountains where winter temps fall below freezing, snow levels can get into several feet and there is little to no public services for simple things such as snow removal.  Power outages are frequent and can be extended which means loss of well water, lights and heat if you aren’t heating with wood.  In the summer, it can get into triple digit heat and rainwater isn’t common.  Preparing for these type of environments means developing robust, reliable solutions.  Anyone can setup a system to water animals but we’ll show you how you can water your animals without it freezing solid in negative temps without using expensive electric heaters?  We’ll show you how to garden successfully when your growing season is too short for fruits and vegetables to ripen before freezing fall temps come in.
