                <h2>What to expect</h2>
                <p>
                    We share our mistakes and challenges and what we’ve learned in hopes to inspire you. You’ll be able to see what we’ve faced and how we dealt with it so you’ll know what you can expect when starting up something like raising 4h sheep and pigs, training a wild mustang, harvesting firewood or building a greenhouse.
                </p>
                <h2>DIY Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    We don’t just show mistakes and challenges. We want to show our viable and sustainable solutions. You can expect to find clear images with steps-by-step instructions detailing what supplies and materials and tools are needed to for a successful project. Using this, you’ll be able to work through your own solutions and adapt as needed for your unique challenges. Doing it yourself empowers you as you learn to be self-reliant and capable. It can also save you considerable cost if done right.
                </p>
                <h2>Gear & Tools Recommendations</h2>
                <p>
                    You would think that harvesting 10 cords of wood a year would require a big and expensive splitter. It’s often one of the first things we see people purchasing when getting into harvesting their own firewood. However, we’ve found a simple, small (and cheap) electric splitter is just as effective and often faster. As we’ve gone through our journey, we’ve learned the value of the right tools and equipment. That does not always mean the most expensive ones. In fact, it often doesn’t. Our hope is to help provide an idea of what you should expect to need to get started and what will be needed down the road. We share what we’ve proven as effective and reliable so you can be sure you’re making a good investment. We’ll also share what we’ve tried that wasn’t reliable or effective so you know what to avoid.
