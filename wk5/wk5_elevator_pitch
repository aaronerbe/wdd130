1.  Identify your idea or goal
        I want to develop a website targetting people looking for help with Hobby Farming, DIY Projects and Mountain Living.
2.  Explain what you want the website to do
        The website would be a blog format documenting projects, providing tips and ideas as well as sharing equipment and tools to help with managing a hobby farm in the mountain environment which includes harsh winter conditions and limited access to public resources.  
3.  Communicate your USP (Unique Selling Proposition).
        I live the mountains on an 8-acre meadow surrounded by forest.  We engage with 4H so have raised horses, pigs, sheep, rabbits and chickens in a reasonably harsh environment.  Utilzing my Engineering and mechanical skills, I have built and designed innovative solutions that I'm sure others will find valuable.  
4.  Engage with a question.
        For example, how would you manage watering animals through the winter when temps frequently fall below 0*F in the nights.  I've designed a solution to the water trough from turning into a giant block of ice without requiring electricity for water heaters.  It's an elegant and simple solution that would benefit anyone trying to water their animals through winter.
