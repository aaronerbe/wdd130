#LAYOUT/COMPOSITION
""""
Think like a designer
    Proximity
        Visual Space to show relationships
        Make sure related items are together
        Unrelated should be seperated
    Whitespace
        Between content and line and margins
        Defines and seperate sections.  
        give content room to breath

    Alignment
        Be consistent
            Look at it as invisible grids
    Contrast
        One item different from another
        catch attention, emphasize, etc
        Color, Size, Weight, Text
        Hierarchy:
            Shows where to begin and where to go next using visual emphasies
                Decide what you want htem to see first and 
    Repetition:
        consistent look and feel
        repeat or echo
            color pallet
            header styles
        makes it easier to read
            allows them to focus on content
