    <h2>Aaron Erbe</h2>
    <p>I live in Idaho City, Idaho.  My wife and I just celebrated our 22nd anniversary last month.  We are blessed with 5 great kids.  Two of which are in college.  My oldest attends BYUI on-site.  My 2nd oldest son attends University of Idaho.  I graduated with a degree in Electrical Engineering from BSU in 2007.  I love the work I do, however did not learn any programming or software development.  I have stumbled my way through some web development and scripting in the past as needed.  However, it's become clear to me that these are highly valued skills in nearly any job.  I've decided it was time to close this skillset gap and perhaps shift direction in my career - or at the least advance my career.  This is my first semester at BYUI and I am admittedly nervous about managing the school, family and workload.  However, I am excited to be learning again.  </p>

    <p>I served a mission (many years ago) in Nebraska Omaha.  My mission was a turning point in my life.  Along with the many life lessons I learned and testimony I gained, it really opened my eyes up to the idea that I could be and do whatever I set my mind to.  While that may seem trivial, this simple principle changed my life and set me on a path to attend college and meet my wife.  It's also effected hobbies and habbits since then.  </p>
    
    <p>Speaking of hobbies, we live in the mountains with countless miles of trails around us.  So we spend a lot of time riding dirtbikes (mostly my kids) and side-by-sides (mostly my wife and I).  We are also nearby the Sawtooth mountain range.  So naturally backpacking and camping is something we try to take advantage of as often as we can.  My kids are involved in 4H, so things like horses, sheep, pigs and chickens occupy a lot of our time as well.  Come winter time, my family loves to get up skiing or boarding as often as we can. </p>
